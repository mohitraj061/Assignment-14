    "RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is a color model used in computer graphics and digital imaging to represent \n",
    "colors and their transparency. Each component of the RGBA model represents the intensity of the respective color channel, \n",

    "The first three components, Red, Green, and Blue, represent the primary colors that are combined in different proportions to\n",
    "create a wide range of colors. The Alpha component represents the transparency or opacity of the color. A value of 0 means \n",

    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",

    "Ques 3.) What is a box tuple, and how does it work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the context of the Pillow module in Python, a box tuple refers to a tuple that defines a rectangular region or bounding box.\n",
    "It is commonly used in various image manipulation operations to specify a specific area of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "A box tuple typically consists of four values : (left, upper, right, lower). Here's a breakdown of each value :\n",
    "\n",
    "* left : The x-coordinate of the left edge of the bounding box.\n",
    "* upper : The y-coordinate of the upper edge of the bounding box.\n",
    "* right : The x-coordinate of the right edge of the bounding box.\n",
    "* lower : The y-coordinate of the lower edge of the bounding box.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The coordinates are typically measured with the origin (0, 0) at the top-left corner of the image, where the x-axis increases\n",
    "from left to right, and the y-axis increases from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing operations that involve a specific region of an image, such as cropping or extracting a sub-image, we can \n",
    "specify the box tuple to define the area of interest. The box tuple allows us to precisely define the rectangular region by \n",
    "specifying the coordinates of its four edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to crop an image using a box tuple, we can use the crop method from the Pillow module as follows :\n",
